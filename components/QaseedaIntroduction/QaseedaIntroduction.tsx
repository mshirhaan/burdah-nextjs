          wrote this Qasidah after having suffered a stroke and being paralysed
          in half his body. After compiling this Qasidah, he went to sleep. He

          <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">
            صلى الله عليه وسلم
          </span>{" "}

          him with His sacred shawl. Instantly, he was cured. When he woke up,

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The next day, when he came out of his house, he met a Dervish (Holy
          person) who was a stranger to him. The Dervish asked him to recite the
          Qasidah, which he had written in praise of the Holy Prophet{" "}
          <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">
            صلى الله عليه وسلم
          </span>
          . He asked the Dervish which Qasidah he was referring to. He said the
          one you recited in front of The Most Beloved{" "}
          <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">
            صلى الله عليه وسلم
          </span>{" "}
          in the blessed court last night. The news of this spread far and wide.
          Hence, the Qasidah came to be called Qasidah tu'l Burdah and received
          veneration among all Muslims as a Qasidah especially approved by the
          Beloved Prophet{" "}
          <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">

          </span>
          .

          Its verses are often memorised and inscribed on the walls of public
          buildings. It is congregationally recited in the majalis (spiritual
          gatherings) of the Zaakireen (those who remember Allah Ta'ala) all
          over the world. It cures diseases as well as purifies hearts if
          recited with love and devotion.
